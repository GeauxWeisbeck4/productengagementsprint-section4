*From Section 4 Sprint Site*: "Why is it that some behaviors become habits while others don’t? And how can you spot these behaviors and begin to turn them into habits? In this first module, you’ll learn how to assess a behavior’s habit-forming potential and begin its habituation through triggers — the first phase of the sprint’s central framework, the Hooked Model."

# I. The Habit Zone

*From Sprint Site*: "Building habit-forming products is a powerful way to increase customer engagement and loyalty while lowering marketing costs. However, becoming a habitual part of your customers’ lives is no easy task, especially if you’re focused on the wrong behavior. In this video, you’ll learn the defining characteristics of habits and how to determine a behavior’s habit-forming potential."

I read the book *The Power of Habits* by Charles Duhigg a few years ago and it was a game changer for me. I learned about the habit zone and how it's the key to understanding how habits are formed. The habit zone is the space between the cue and the reward. Its the space where the behavior happens, the habit is formed and also where the habit is broken.

This sprint starts off by talking about the Habit Zone in context of creating engaging products. Before we get started too deep into the habit zone, let's talk about habits and hop into module!

## The Value of Habits

`Habit`: impulse to do a behavior with little or no conscious thought
**What kind of apps do you use habitually?**
  - Financial app, workout app, calm, headspace
    - What are the triggers for these apps?
      - Cash App/PayPal: when you get paid, when you get a notification
      - Workout app: Little 5 minute reminders on my running app that tell me how far I've run
      - Calm: Reminders to meditate and they also have streaks
  - We can create habit forming products that make users lives better

Habits truly govern our life - they make up for over half of all our daily activities. Habits are the reason we brush our teeth, go to work, and eat breakfast. One habit that we all have is our massive addiction to our smart phones. We can't go more thn 15 minutes without checking to make sure we don't miss anything. Consider the massive advantage you get when you create a product that forms a habit - you get a customer for life.

### What can habits do for our products?

1. Habits increase lifetime customer value
2. Habits drive growth
3. Huge sustainable competitive advantage
   - How many times a day do we search on Google without using or thinking about other alternatives?

Things like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have become almost second nature to us. I have sent so many Tweets with out even realizing what I did, only to be surprised with a bunch of retweets later. That is why these companies are so successful. They have created habits that we can't break.

We have a framework we can use to hack into these habits - the Habit Zone. 

## The Habit Zone

The Habit Zone is a simple frameworkto determine if a customer behavior has habit forming potential. Here are the the two main parts of steps that make up the Habit Zone:

1. What behavior do you want your users to do with little or no conscious thought
2. Plot it and we have The Habit Zone

![The Habit Zone](public/static/images/habitzone.png)

- Frequency
  More frequency means more likely that behavior will be a habit

- Bolt Infrequently used products
  Bolt a frequently occurring behavior on an infrequently used product
- Content and Community

Ex. - cookware Williams Sonoma we don't buy all the time. They made their website artistic with cool content, posted multiple times per day to hook people to the content consumption, when it is time to monetize, people will buy the cookware from williams sonoma

Community - Nike lululemon and yoga pants
Hallmark - Ornaments: bolted a community habit around ornaments, unpack ornaments through the year

Perceived utility
-It has to provide value

- how useful or rewarding a new behavior could be vs alternatives
  Discovering Utility

1. Think of existing problems that don't have a solution yet.
2. Consder behaviors people aspire to perform
3. Look for simple behaviors

Plotting Behaviors

1. Estimate frequency by lookaing at data on current usage or making an educated guess
2. Estimate how much utility your product provides vs. alternatives

- Direct traffic

Is this habit good for business?

1. Is the behavior specific?
   - clear verb-noun combo
   - can be measured with one metric
2. Is behavior strategic?
   - Aligns with the goals of the organization
   - does improving the metric improve the business?

Takeaways

1. Technology is not a requirement for a habit forming product
2. Evaluate the habit-forming potential of several behaviors
3. Prioritize high frequency behaviors

## Hooked Model: Triggers

Psychology of Engagement
TRIGGER -> ACTION -> Variable Reward ->
Subtle pattern four phase cycle

- Designed connects users problem to your product with enough frequency to form a habit
- First successful cycle, preferences are shaped and tastes are formed

## 1. Trigger Phase

- Trigger: Call to action, pings us to do something with information
- Think about all the fuckin notifications we get each day
- External Triggers propel users in the hooked model
- Internal Triggers uncomfortable emotional state taht we seek to escape from
- bordeom, stress, anxiety, loneliness
  - Products used make them feel good
- Bordeom - TikTok
- Unsure - Google

Association - mental connection between two parts of the cycle

Prompting internal triggers

The Five Whys - LinkedIn
Why? - Check Messages
Why? Avoid missed opporunities
Why? Looking for a new job
Why? Don't like our current job
Why? Excluded from conversations

- Do additional internal triggers
- Habits are strengthened with increased frequency

ex. Trigger - Fatigue -> Action - Log into Uber Eats

Magnitude of trigger

# Default For Frequency

Uber Eats
Persona - Who is your user?

1. Create a Customer Persona: who would use your product or service?

Internal Trigger - What are they feeling? 2. Identify the customer's internal trigger

Context - What are they doing? Where? When? 3. Establish the context: time and place when your customer experiences the internal trigger

Once you have a hypothesis, you can begin to 4. Design an external trigger: immediately follow the internal trigger and appeal to its relief

Tips: Ask to see their calendar, use geolocation info

Every time a customer satisfies an internal trigger, stengthens the association

Association X: The association you want users to form 5. Visualize the Association - it's a mental

Uber Eats
too tired to coook = loggin into app

Instagrtam
Fear of not capturing a moment = snapping a picture

Key Takeaways

1. Focus on one internal trigger at a time
2. External triggers are the training wheels of habits
3. Effective CTA are also possible for non-tech products

3. Notifies you of deal at checkout.
4. Association through saving money

Keyu Learnings

1. Keep customers in the hooked cycle by continually improving the product
2. Simplicity is best for external triggers
