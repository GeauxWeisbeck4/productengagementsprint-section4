# Testing Habits 

1. Access time-stamped data to see how people interact with the app 
- Basing on one metric is not a great way to keep metrics 
2. Calculate the percentage of habituated users
- You have to decide what a habituated user looks like 
- Set a reasonable threshold and guesstimate
- A good metric is 20% or over that are habituated users
3. Find a cohort of users 
- New product features will be released to one cohort 
4. Do a cohort analysis 
- Tells us if we should keep the feature or not
    a. Capture your baseline 
    at least 16% of seattle
    b. Form a hypothesis 
    Make a change to your product design and see if the level of habituated users went up or down 
    c. Define the cohort or target 
    d. Compare the data 
    If new app users are higher than baseline data, you can keep the feature 
- Evernote percentage of users upgrading to paid version was low at first, but then after year two and then it signfiiciantly increased 
    - Reason for the smile graph? Users made an investment, left, missed the investment and came back
