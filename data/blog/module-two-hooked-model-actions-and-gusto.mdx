*Even the best trigger is worthless if customers don’t perform the intended behavior in the second phase of the Hooked Model: Actions. To sustain a trigger’s momentum and increase the likelihood of customers performing the intended behavior, make the action phase as simple to complete as possible. In this video, you’ll learn the most common hurdles customers face and how to overcome them with heuristics. *

# Sustaining Engagement 

*In this module, you’ll learn the next two phases of the Hooked Model: the action phase and the variable reward phase. In the action phase, customers perform the behavior your product intends to habituate. The action phase is closely followed by the reward phase, where customers get the relief they came for. To learn more about how to ensure customers complete the action phase and receive a satisfying reward, watch the two lessons and case studies below.*

## I. Hooked Model - Actions 
Psychology of engagement - customers must take action.
Triggered by boredom users are thrust into action of Instagram - scrolling feed

Make it easier for customers to take action - reduce friction, reduce steps = more likely to do behavior

- Ex. Keurig - 1 button to make coffee, 1 button to make tea. Keurig takes half of 5 minute brew time of regular coffee 
    - even though way more expensive 

### Customer Journey Map 
- Map out all the steps a customer takes to get to a desired outcome 

Start feel internal trogger to take action 

Six hurdles
1. Time - the longer it takes, less likely we are to do it 
- Google drive reduces time to view teammate docs 
2. Money - the more it costs, less likely we are to do it
- Amazone partners with Affirm buy now pay later
3. Effort - the more effort it takes, less likely we are to do it
- Physical effort of pumping breastmilk - willow reduces this effot with breatsmilk pumping 
4. Cognitive Load - The harder it is to understand, less likely to do 
- Most apps use similar icons to make it easier to understand - accessibility 
5. Non-routine - Less familiar we are with a behavior, less likely to do it 
- Headspace and 10% happier - incorporate routines into meditation 
6. Social deviance - Less socially acceptable, less likely to do it 
- Michael Phelps and mental health with talk space

- Next step is to remove friction points
WE've developed heuristics - cognitive shortcuts to help us make decisions in a world full of choices
- Thinking fast book 

Four Brain biases
- Anchoring: Anchoring price of discount to original price - using old info
- Scarcity: Value things more the less available they are 
- Framing: Making something more attractive by changing the way it is presented. Southwest airlines, slogan reduces cognitive load with a question "wanna get awayu"
- Endowed Progress: More effort we put into something, the more likely we are to complete it because we have invested effort 

Identify how heuristics can reduce friction

Not all actions should be made easier. If we want the user to think about something, we want them to take more time and think about it 
- ex. trading app want them to think more instead of recklessly trading 
- ex. GitHub - finds potential conflicts and makes you review it before making it live

Key Takeaways
1. The action phase is a temporary relief of the action model 
2. Each hurdle is specific, and depends on the customer and context 
3. Consider the long-term consequences before you apply heuristics 
-example discounting products habituates users to expect discounts 
4. Leverage heurristics to help customers do the things they want to do, rather than have to do 

## II. Actions: Gusto 

*For small businesses, back-office tasks like payroll can be a frequent and time-intensive undertaking prone to costly errors. Recognizing this need, Gusto simplified payroll into a simple and reliable feature that runs payroll in 60 seconds. Today, 98% of trial users convert to Gusto’s paid plan.*

- Small businesses spend 21 days a year doing payroll
- Gusto - payroll, benefits, and HR software 
- ENtire backoffice in single Platform
- Helps overcome time physical effort and cognitive load and money 
- Uses framing and endowed progress to help small businesses navigate a resource draining activity 

- hurdle 1: time 
- Takes a whole day to process payroll and 2-3 days to deposit 
- Most small businesses do payroll manually - but with gusto it takes 60 seconds

hurdle 2; physical effort and cognitive load 
- storing payroll and employee info in cloud to leave historical record to make it easy to accomplish HR tasks
- 8% error rate it reduces 
- Business owners describe payroll as confusing, frustrating, and time consuming 
- Sends out email reminders before payroll process initiates 

hurdle 3: money
- Customers avoid tax penalties and late fees 
- 40% of businesses get fined $845 for payroll tax penalties

Takeaways
1. Hurdles can have more than one solution, and one heuristic can solve many hurdles
2. Go further than simply addresing obvious hurdles to show value to the customer
