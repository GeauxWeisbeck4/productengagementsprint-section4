Welcome to my blog website for Section 4's Product Engagement Sprint. I'm excited to share my experience with you and hope you enjoy reading about it!

# The Product Engagement Sprint Website 

This sprint focuses on creating habit forming products and is taught by Nir Eyal. It has been super helpful so far and I finally have a solid product that I am going to work on - my Moon Buddha app! 

Let me talk a bit about the functionality of the website, the history of this template, and more.
