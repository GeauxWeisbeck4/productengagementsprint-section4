*From Section 4 Website*: "The first phase of the Hooked Model is Triggers, the rings, dings, and pings that propel customers into action. While some triggers feel like spam, others appear as perfectly timed relief. What separates noise from magic? Context. In this video, youâ€™ll learn how to design context-aware triggers that catalyze engagement. "

## Hooked Model: Triggers

As a quick reminder:
TRIGGER -> ACTION -> Variable Reward ->
Subtle pattern four phase cycle

- Designed connects users problem to your product with enough frequency to form a habit
- First successful cycle, preferences are shaped and tastes are formed

## 1. Trigger Phase

- Trigger: Call to action, pings us to do something with information
- Think about all the fuckin notifications we get each day
- External Triggers propel users in the hooked model
- Internal Triggers uncomfortable emotional state that we seek to escape from

Let's just take a moment and think of all the products that trigger us:

Often times we use products to alleviate boredom, stress or anxiety. When we think of Google, we use it to help us look things up when we are unsure of what to do. We use Tik Tok when we are bored or Tweet to express our feelings. We use Instagram to see what our friends are up to. We use Facebook to connect with friends and family.

## Association 

Association is the mental connection between a trigger and a behavior. We prompt new behaviors by associating them with existing ones. One way of discovering triggers is to use 'The Five Whys' model to figure out why our customers do the actions they do. 

Let's take a look at LinkedIn for a good example:

The Five Whys - LinkedIn
Why? - Check Messages
Why? Avoid missed opporunities
Why? Looking for a new job
Why? Don't like our current job
Why? Excluded from conversations

4. Design an external trigger: immediately follow the internal trigger and appeal to its relief

Tips: Ask to see their calendar, use geolocation info

Every time a customer satisfies an internal trigger, stengthens the association

Association X: The association you want users to form 

5. Visualize the Association - it's a mental

2. External triggers are the training wheels of habits
3. Effective CTA are also possible for non-tech products
