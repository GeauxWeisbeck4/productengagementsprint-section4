# Module Three - Improving Engagement

*In this module, we’ll cover the final phase of the Hooked Model, investments. The goal of the investment phase is to bring customers back into and through another Hook cycle, further cementing a habit. To know for sure whether habits are taking hold, teams must continuously test their products. In the second lesson of this module, we’ll cover a method for analyzing a project’s habit-forming impact.*

# Improving Engagement

Let's cover the final phase of the hooked model, investments.

## Hooked Model: investments

Small actions the users take to improve the products use and improve the users chance of coming back and using it again

Twitter keeps you coming back by following more people and more people follow you 
Spotify keeps improving your playlist and keeps you coming back for more

These impcrease frequency of use and increase perceived utility. 

## The Ikea Effect 
WE are more likely to like a product the more time and effort we invest into it.
Reasons why?
- Reciprocity: When we feel like someone has done us a favor we want to  pay it back 
- We invest in relationships to make them better; we do the same with products for that reason.

## Building investments 
1. Storing Value: The products and services we use are getting better the more we use them for the first time ever.
- The more content you upload, the better it becomes. Dropbox 
a. content 
b. Skill Acquisition - The more valuable a drive becomes the more the user knows how to use it 
c. Data - The more data you have the more valuable it becomes. Mint, Bottomless Coffee
d. Reputation - store in the form of views or scores. Can take to the bank. Air BnB, Ebay 
e. Followers - More valuable the more followers you have 
f. credit - Storing perks or benefits in a the form of a card. Frequent flyers 

2. Loading the next trigger: allowing customers own behavior to bring them back with their own behavior. The more rounds the customer takes through the model, the more likely  they will be hooked. 
- Don't ask for everything at once - ask for little bits each pass through. Figma 

## Key Takeaways 
1. Create long-term benefits that will bring customers back over time. 
- Social media gets better with mach use 
2. Investments play a key role in building associations, including investments. 
- Can't have a good product just by giving users what they want. Need customers to make it better with each use in the investment phase.
