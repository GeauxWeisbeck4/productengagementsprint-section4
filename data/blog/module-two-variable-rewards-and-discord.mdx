*Customers have given you their precious time and attention, now it’s time to reward them in the third phase of the Hooked Model: Variable Rewards. Not any old reward will do, however. All satisfying rewards understand one thing: a customer’s preference for variability. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to determine customers’ preferences for variability and how to leverage 3 types of rewards that appeal to our hard-wired desires.*

## III. Variable Rewards 

-Must understand two things:
Degree of variablity types of rewards

High degree of variability is good: feeds - keep scrolling to see new content, infinite variability. Creates a habit 
-Predicitability reduces how much you want to use it 
- Sometimes you do want to reduce it - ATM withdrawals
- User must maintain a sense of agency - user must own it 
- Uber can make us anxious because we don't know driver or if we'll get ther in time they reduce it by giving users more agency and control

Uber - Tells you how far your ride is, how long it takes to get where your going

Rewards - Self, Tribe, Hunt
-Play off our deepest instincts primal desires
- tribe: need to be cared for by other - Rewards that appeal to our desire to appeal to our community, h
- hunt: gathering resources - Rewards that provide information or monetary rewards - Ross treasure hunts
- self: mastery or agency - Rewards that provide personal gratification - Apple Watch activity rings 

Email is ultimate habit forming
- tribe: not sure who might respond
- hunt: don't know whats in email 
- self: gratification of sending email, tracking read messages

2. To hold attention, add degrees of varaiability 
- Uber needs to be predictable, but provides variability - changing colors of cars on map 
2. Rewards of the tribe have the longest-lasting impact
