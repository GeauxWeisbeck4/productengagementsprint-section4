# Module One - The Habit Zone

## 1. The Habit Zone

Psychology of Engagement

- Value of Habits
  - Habit is an impulse to do a behavior with little or no conscious thought
  - Financial app, workout app, calm, headspace
  - We can create habit forming products that make users lives better

"Our habits govern our lives - research shows that around half of our actions every day are driven by repitition"

- Can't live without our phones

1. Habits increase lifetime customer value
2. Habits drive growth
3. Huge sustainable competitive advantage
   - How many times a day do we search on Google without using or thinking about other alternatives?

- The Habit Zone

1. What behavior do you want your users to do with little or no conscious thought
2. Plot it and we have The Habit Zone
   - Simple framework to determine if a customer behavior has habit forming potential

- Frequency
  More frequency means more likely that behavior will be a habit

- Bolt Infrequently used products
  Bolt a frequently occurring behavior on an infrequently used product
- Content and Community

Ex. - cookware Williams Sonoma we don't buy all the time. They made their website artistic with cool content, posted multiple times per day to hook people to the content consumption, when it is time to monetize, people will buy the cookware from williams sonoma

Community - Nike lululemon and yoga pants
Hallmark - Ornaments: bolted a community habit around ornaments, unpack ornaments through the year

Perceived utility
-It has to provide value

- how useful or rewarding a new behavior could be vs alternatives
  Discovering Utility

1. Think of existing problems that don't have a solution yet.
2. Consder behaviors people aspire to perform
3. Look for simple behaviors

Plotting Behaviors

1. Estimate frequency by lookaing at data on current usage or making an educated guess
2. Estimate how much utility your product provides vs. alternatives

- Direct traffic

Is this habit good for business?

1. Is the behavior specific?
   - clear verb-noun combo
   - can be measured with one metric
2. Is behavior strategic?
   - Aligns with the goals of the organization
   - does improving the metric improve the business?

Takeaways

1. Technology is not a requirement for a habit forming product
2. Evaluate the habit-forming potential of several behaviors
3. Prioritize high frequency behaviors

## Hooked Model: Triggers

Psychology of Engagement
TRIGGER -> ACTION -> Variable Reward ->
Subtle pattern four phase cycle

- First successful cycle, preferences are shaped and tastes are formed

## 1. Trigger Phase

- Trigger: Call to action, pings us to do something with information
- Think about all the fuckin notifications we get each day
- External Triggers propel users in the hooked model
- Internal Triggers uncomfortable emotional state taht we seek to escape from
- bordeom, stress, anxiety, loneliness
  - Products used make them feel good

Once you have a hypothesis, you can begin to 4. Design an external trigger: immediately follow the internal trigger and appeal to its relief

Tips: Ask to see their calendar, use geolocation info

Every time a customer satisfies an internal trigger, stengthens the association

Association X: The association you want users to form 5. Visualize the Association - it's a mental
