# Sustaining Engagement 

## I. Hooked Model - Actions 
Psychology of engagement - customers must take action.
Triggered by boredom users are thrust into action of Instagram - scrolling feed

Make it easier for customers to take action - reduce friction, reduce steps = more likely to do behavior

- Ex. Keurig - 1 button to make coffee, 1 button to make tea. Keurig takes half of 5 minute brew time of regular coffee 
    - even though way more expensive 

### Customer Journey Map 
- Map out all the steps a customer takes to get to a desired outcome 

Start feel internal trogger to take action 

Six hurdles
1. Time - the longer it takes, less likely we are to do it 
- Google drive reduces time to view teammate docs 
2. Money - the more it costs, less likely we are to do it
- Amazone partners with Affirm buy now pay later
3. Effort - the more effort it takes, less likely we are to do it
- Physical effort of pumping breastmilk - willow reduces this effot with breatsmilk pumping 
4. Cognitive Load - The harder it is to understand, less likely to do 
- Most apps use similar icons to make it easier to understand - accessibility 
5. Non-routine - Less familiar we are with a behavior, less likely to do it 
- Headspace and 10% happier - incorporate routines into meditation 
6. Social deviance - Less socially acceptable, less likely to do it 
- Michael Phelps and mental health with talk space

- Next step is to remove friction points
WE've developed heuristics - cognitive shortcuts to help us make decisions in a world full of choices
- Thinking fast book 

Four Brain biases
- Anchoring: Anchoring price of discount to original price - using old info
- Scarcity: Value things more the less available they are 
- Framing: Making something more attractive by changing the way it is presented. Southwest airlines, slogan reduces cognitive load with a question "wanna get awayu"
- Endowed Progress: More effort we put into something, the more likely we are to complete it because we have invested effort 

Identify how heuristics can reduce friction

Not all actions should be made easier. If we want the user to think about something, we want them to take more time and think about it 
- ex. trading app want them to think more instead of recklessly trading 
- ex. GitHub - finds potential conflicts and makes you review it before making it live

Key Takeaways
1. The action phase is a temporary relief of the action model 
2. Each hurdle is specific, and depends on the customer and context 
3. Consider the long-term consequences before you apply heuristics 
-example discounting products habituates users to expect discounts 
4. Leverage heurristics to help customers do the things they want to do, rather than have to do 

## II. Actions: Gusto 
- Small businesses spend 21 days a year doing payroll
- Gusto - payroll, benefits, and HR software 
- ENtire backoffice in single Platform
- Helps overcome time physical effort and cognitive load and money 
- Uses framing and endowed progress to help small businesses navigate a resource draining activity 

- hurdle 1: time 
- Takes a whole day to process payroll and 2-3 days to deposit 
- Most small businesses do payroll manually - but with gusto it takes 60 seconds

hurdle 2; physical effort and cognitive load 
- storing payroll and employee info in cloud to leave historical record to make it easy to accomplish HR tasks
- 8% error rate it reduces 
- Business owners describe payroll as confusing, frustrating, and time consuming 
- Sends out email reminders before payroll process initiates 

hurdle 3: money
- Customers avoid tax penalties and late fees 
- 40% of businesses get fined $845 for payroll tax penalties

Takeaways
1. Hurdles can have more than one solution, and one heuristic can solve many hurdles
2. Go further than simply addresing obvious hurdles to show value to the customer 

## III. Variable Rewards 

-Must understand two things:
Degree of variablity types of rewards

High degree of variability is good: feeds - keep scrolling to see new content, infinite variability. Creates a habit 
-Predicitability reduces how much you want to use it 
- Sometimes you do want to reduce it - ATM withdrawals
- User must maintain a sense of agency - user must own it 
- Uber can make us anxious because we don't know driver or if we'll get ther in time they reduce it by giving users more agency and control

Uber - Tells you how far your ride is, how long it takes to get where your going

Rewards - Self, Tribe, Hunt
-Play off our deepest instincts primal desires
- tribe: need to be cared for by other - Rewards that appeal to our desire to appeal to our community, h
- hunt: gathering resources - Rewards that provide information or monetary rewards - Ross treasure hunts
- self: mastery or agency - Rewards that provide personal gratification - Apple Watch activity rings 

Email is ultimate habit forming
- tribe: not sure who might respond
- hunt: don't know whats in email 
- self: gratification of sending email, tracking read messages 

Designing Rewards
1. Identify the emotion you want to transition your customer towards
- Boredom - entertain them 
- Create a spectrum with opposite feelings on each end 
2. Determine the Customer's Level of Variability 
- Create variabbility with inhouse created content and user created content 
- New nintendo games or new hbo show 
- curated: user generated content like YouTube or Instagram 
- Product Hunt, Stitch Fix 
- Don't want want variablitity  - clarify unknowns that drive trigger 
- Salesforce - which leads are best and who to reach out to 
- Smart water bottle 
    - Self: Hydration saved, platic bottles 
    - Tribe: Donation Leaderboard 
    - Hunt: Plant a tree
3. Prioritize Rewards 
- Prioritize most satisfying rewards 
- Balance the prioritization with the cost of implementation 

Key Takeaways 
1. The same product can add or reduce variability 
- Google Maps: How to get from point a to point b, suggest restaurants, and suggest places to go 
2. To hold attention, add degrees of varaiability 
- Uber needs to be predictable, but provides variability - changing colors of cars on map 
2. Rewards of the tribe have the longest-lasting impact 


## IV. Variable Rewards: Discord 
- Discord was initially meant to be a messaging service for gamers 
- Between 2016-2021 grew by fourteen times 
- reliable, sleek and efficient 

1. Idenitfy the emotion that satisfies the trigger 
- To alleviate gamers frustration of gamer messaging 
- Made a better service to communicate and hang with others 
- They sent more encouraging message sthan tasks 

2. Assess the need for variablity based on internal trigger 
- Streamlined messaging platform efficient 

3. Determine potential rewards and prioritze customer relief
- Uses rewards of the tribe to provide three resolutions for communicating with others
1. Create a space for multiplayer communication 
 - 2021 over 19 million servers covering a variety of topics 
2. VOIP that is better and more faster than any competitors 
- most popular discord servers 
3. Low barriers to entry
- Feemium plan includes creating servers, participating on teams, etc 
- Paid subscription adds HD and other stuff 
- Free satisfies most users needs 

Key learnings
1. Rewards of the tribe are most likely to encourage repeat interaction 
2. Depending on consumer needs, one product can bothe reduce and increase variability
