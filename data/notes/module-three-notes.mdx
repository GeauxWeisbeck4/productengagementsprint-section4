# Improving Engagement

Let's cover the final phase of the hooked model, investments.

## Hooked Model: investments

Small actions the users take to improve the products use and improve the users chance of coming back and using it again

Twitter keeps you coming back by following more people and more people follow you 
Spotify keeps improving your playlist and keeps you coming back for more

These impcrease frequency of use and increase perceived utility. 

## The Ikea Effect 
WE are more likely to like a product the more time and effort we invest into it.
Reasons why?
- Reciprocity: When we feel like someone has done us a favor we want to  pay it back 
- We invest in relationships to make them better; we do the same with products for that reason.

## Building investments 
1. Storing Value: The products and services we use are getting better the more we use them for the first time ever.
- The more content you upload, the better it becomes. Dropbox 
a. content 
b. Skill Acquisition - The more valuable a drive becomes the more the user knows how to use it 
c. Data - The more data you have the more valuable it becomes. Mint, Bottomless Coffee
d. Reputation - store in the form of views or scores. Can take to the bank. Air BnB, Ebay 
e. Followers - More valuable the more followers you have 
f. credit - Storing perks or benefits in a the form of a card. Frequent flyers 

2. Loading the next trigger: allowing customers own behavior to bring them back with their own behavior. The more rounds the customer takes through the model, the more likely  they will be hooked. 
- Don't ask for everything at once - ask for little bits each pass through. Figma 

## Key Takeaways 
1. Create long-term benefits that will bring customers back over time. 
- Social media gets better with mach use 
2. Investments play a key role in building associations, including investments. 
- Can't have a good product just by giving users what they want. Need customers to make it better with each use in the investment phase.


# Investments: Figma 

Focuses on collaboration to speed up workflows like GitHub 
Share create and collaborate in one place. 

Annual Recurring Revenue - Figma 
2020: $75 Million 
2021: $128 Million 

1. Loading the next trigger: Every user generated piece of content makes the tool more useful to designers
2. SKill Investment - While it is very accessible, it as also filled with ways to upgrade your skills 
 - Lessons and tutorials on website 
3. Collect and utilize data - Uses customer support tickets to make the tool better - created FigJam during the pandemic 

# Key learnings 

1. The purpose of investments is to load the next trigger 
2. Focus on small and regular investments 
3. Different strategies are necessary to encourage spread across groups 


# Testing Habits 

1. Access time-stamped data to see how people interact with the app 
- Basing on one metric is not a great way to keep metrics 
2. Calculate the percentage of habituated users
- You have to decide what a habituated user looks like 
- Set a reasonable threshold and guesstimate
- A good metric is 20% or over that are habituated users
3. Find a cohort of users 
- New product features will be released to one cohort 
4. Do a cohort analysis 
- Tells us if we should keep the feature or not
    a. Capture your baseline 
    at least 16% of seattle
    b. Form a hypothesis 
    Make a change to your product design and see if the level of habituated users went up or down 
    c. Define the cohort or target 
    d. Compare the data 
    If new app users are higher than baseline data, you can keep the feature 
- Evernote percentage of users upgrading to paid version was low at first, but then after year two and then it signfiiciantly increased 
    - Reason for the smile graph? Users made an investment, left, missed the investment and came back 

# Key Learning 

1. Test quickly early and often 
2. Enagement before revenue 

# Testing Hooks: Amazon Echo

Continue to buy and test their hooks to make it easier to buy from Amazon. 

Alexa helped you shop across the room. Started as an overqualified speaker.

1. Establish percentage of habitual users 

2. Use cohort analysis

Used cohort testing by buying skets and prototypes to a long-standing pool of more than 100 customers. Persuade customers to place devices in prime locations in their home. THey collect a lot of data. It helped them design the echo. 

They are so commited to cohort testing they actually have a whole website dedicated to it.
20 million own more than one echo 

# Key Leanrings 
1. Even a successful product can be habit tested to increase customer use 
2. Monetization comes through engagement. 

Leads to increased engagement and revenue in ecosystem
