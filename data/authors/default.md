Andrew Weisbeck is a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, life-long learner, and creative human being. He resides in Raleigh, NC with his beautiful partner, Lisa Heusner, their two cats (Beaux and Zulu), and an Australian Cattle Dog mix name Magnolia.

Andrew's passions include programming, blogging, skiing, creating things, learning, reading, music, college football - the list goes on and on. His favorite teams are the Nebraska Cornhuskers, North Carolina Tar Heels and LSU Tigers.

While he has been making websites for over five years and learning programming just as long, Andrew has really put non-stop work into full-stack development since last July when he started a Cyber Security Analyst role for a startup. His favorite language is Python, but Javascript has won a special place in his heart. There's a three way tie when it comes to his favorite app building frameworks - EmberJS, NextJS, and Astro all are too great to pick a top dog.
